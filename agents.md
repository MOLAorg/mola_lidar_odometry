# mola_lidar_odometry repository — AI Agent Context Guide

## Project Overview

**MOLA** (Modular Optimization framework for Localization and mApping) is a modern C++ and ROS 2 framework for robot **localization and SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

This repository provides a LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) frontend for the MOLA framework. 

Official Docs: https://docs.mola-slam.org/latest/

## Building

We use colcon, the ROS2 build tool, and mola_common with utility cmake helpers.

## Testing

- **Framework**: CMake + GTest
- Each package has `tests/` with its own `CMakeLists.txt`
- CI/CD: `.github/workflows/` — builds on ROS 2 Humble, Jazzy, Kilted, Rolling
- Style: enforced with `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy`

## Code style

- Use clang-format-14
- Don't use one line statements: "if (foo) bar;" ==> "if (foo) {\n bar;\n}" ; enforced by clang-tidy rules
- Don't declare more than one variable in the same line: "int a,b;" => "int a;\n int b;"
- Don't use en, em dash "—", use any alternative notation.
- Use American spelling.
