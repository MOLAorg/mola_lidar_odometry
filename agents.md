# mola_lidar_odometry repository — AI Agent Context Guide

## Project Overview

**MOLA** (Modular Optimization framework for Localization and mApping) is a modern C++ and ROS 2 framework for robot **localization and SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

This repository provides a LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) frontend for the MOLA framework. 

Official Docs: https://docs.mola-slam.org/latest/

## State estimator integration

Per LiDAR scan, `LidarOdometry` queries the configured `mola::NavStateFilter`
for a motion prior via `state_.navstate_fuse->estimated_navstate(scan_ref_time,
publish_reference_frame)` (`module/src/LidarOdometry_ProcessScan.cpp`), then feeds
the registered pose back with `fuse_pose()`.

When paired with `mola_state_estimation_smoother` configured with
`async_backend: true`, that per-scan `estimated_navstate()` call does NOT trigger
the smoother's iSAM2 window solve on the LiDAR thread; it returns a fast prediction
from the smoother's lightweight predictor (re-anchored on the last completed
backend solve), while the window solve runs concurrently in the smoother's own
thread. This bounds per-scan latency for real-time use. With the default
`async_backend: false`, `estimated_navstate()` runs the window solve synchronously
(deterministic, but heavier per call) - see `mola_state_estimation`'s docs.

## Building

We use colcon, the ROS2 build tool, and mola_common with utility cmake helpers.

## Testing

- **Framework**: CMake + GTest
- Each package has `tests/` with its own `CMakeLists.txt`
- CI/CD: `.github/workflows/` — builds on ROS 2 Humble, Jazzy, Kilted, Rolling
- Style: enforced with `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy`

## Code style

- Use clang-format-14
- Don't use one line statements: "if (foo) bar;" ==> "if (foo) {\n bar;\n}" ; enforced by clang-tidy rules
- Don't declare more than one variable in the same line: "int a,b;" => "int a;\n int b;"
- Don't use en, em dash "—", use any alternative notation.
- Use American spelling.
- Use anonymous namespaces instead of static.
